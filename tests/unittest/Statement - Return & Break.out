Let's see how Return works
I mean, other than pushing a return value to the stack...
Does it really return?
func(x)--> about to return...
Calculation f(2) = 2*2 = 4
======================
Let's see if that works with a loop...
Looping. I = 1
Looping. I = 2
Looping. I = 3
Looping. I = 4
Found '5'. Returning! 
5
HERE
i = 1
After i = 1
i = 2
After i = 2
i = 3
After i = 3
i = 4
After i = 4
i = 5
breaking...
OUT of break
in funcRetLoopBreak
i = 1
x = 1
x = 2
x = 3
x = 4
x = 5
x = 6
x = 7
x = 8
x = 9
out of loop
i = 2
x = 1
x = 2
x = 3
x = 4
x = 5
x = 6
x = 7
x = 8
x = 9
out of loop
i = 3
x = 1
x = 2
x = 3
x = 4
x = 5
x = 6
out of loop
done
k = 9
k = 3
